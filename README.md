# ShuLIM

A new image slim kit inspired by the needs of some SUSTech societies, esp. the Shuli College's New Media Agency, which
resulted the name `ShuLIM`.

**Features:**

- Slim images of different types to be smaller than any given threshold value.
- Slim images while preserving folder hierarchy of images.
- Cross-platform for both macOS and Windows, based on the Electron framework.
