# SUSlim

A new image slim kit inspired by the needs of some SUSTech societies, which resulted the name `SUSlim`.

**Features:**

- Slim images of different types to be smaller than any given threshold value.
- Slim images while preserving folder hierarchy of images.
- Cross-platform for both macOS and Windows, based on the Electron framework.
